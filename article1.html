     <h2>Social Justice: Fact vs Fiction</h2>

     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>

     <p>Feminists and social justice warriors, both are often referred to as SJWs when typing. They have a terrible habit of making various claims and assumptions based
        off of skewed data, and pure emotion that has no facts or charges to show a positive effect. Besides of course, how a person “feels” in the short term. A few of these claims are quite well known, such as the wage gap between men and women and white men supposedly having more rights. Both of these claims are false, but if you dare challenge these claims you will be called a bigot, a racist, or a sexist. All of these terms used against you are nothing but buzzwords, designed to intimidate and cause people to back off their claims and remarks. I will be touching on several feminist’s claims in this essay, and show just what is fact, and what is fiction.</p>


     <h3>Wage Gap: Fact or Fiction</h3>
     <pre>
     
     
     </pre>
<p>The first claim that I will evaluate is the gender wage gap. The wage gap, is the claim that a woman only makes 75-78% of what a man makes doing the same job. Now this seems accurate if you skew the data. They skew the data by taking all professions, worked by both genders, and then throw it all together to show the average of both, without taking into account all other factors. Now if you were to take into account hours worked, time off from work to raise children or vacation days, and the job worked, you would see the wage gap shrink dramatically to within a 3-5% margin of what the average male gets paid. This disproves the claim that women make less due to simply the private market, and that government must regulate it. This isn't to mention that paying someone unequally just based off of gender is already illegal based off the Equal Pay Act of 1963. There are multiple studies done against this claim by feminist, not to mention that no acclaimed, or respected economist takes the wage gap seriously. For an example, there was a recent study released by a black Harvard professor this year. I will link that article and a couple more at the end of this essay.</p>


     <h3>Unequal Rights: Fact or Fiction</h3>
     <pre>
     
     
     </pre>
<p>The next myth that I will touch on is the unfair rights that whites and men supposedly have over women and minorities in this nation. This one will be a bit harder to debunk, since there is no one to actually debate. Forgive me if I sound as if I'm arguing or asking questions to myself and then answering them. Now I'll begin this section of by asking what law could possibly be discriminatory in its wording or nature? The drug laws that actually do affect both races equally? Is it possibly that minorities have access to affirmative action, which discriminates against whites. It forces some whites to no longer be accepted into colleges simply because the college is trying to meet its racial and gender quota for the year or semester? I fail to see any law that is possibly racist or sexist without also affecting a white male in the same way. Some feminists will try to use the abortion argument as proof that people on the right are waging a so-called “War on Women” and claim that they have some sort of right to taxpayer funded abortion. However, abortion is not a right. It is a privilege to have access to someone who has the capabilities and means to do such an action. Abortion should not even be a government issue since it's a personal decision and therefore should be paid by the person, not the collective, also known as the government which is paid for by taxpayers.</p>

<p>The only other issue I can see, is the one that has only started to grow in popularity in the last couple years, and that is the police brutality issue. Black Lives Matter would be considered a social justice warrior movement, in my opinion. Now, if the law was actually racist towards blacks we would actually see the numbers be a lot higher. The truth is, blacks are actually represented in police shootings relatively equivalently to the amount of convicted crime they commit. Those are convicted crimes, and not just petty crimes like shoplifting or possibly just a simple traffic stop gone wrong, even those do happen. The actual data shows that whites get shot and killed far more often than blacks do (when crime rate is taken into account), which is to be suspected since whites make up a majority of the population. Now, the data shows that whites, make up about 72.4% of the population, and commit about 68.9% of crimes. Blacks make up about 12.6% of the population, but commit 28.3% of crimes, including 52.2% of the homicides committed in the United States. Facts can't be racist, simply because they are just facts. All data gathered here is from 2010 and 2013 because it's the most recent data that could be found to compare in a relatively short time frame when comparing crime rates and percentage of population. Now if you look at police shootings, 24% of those killed in police shootings were black, and 49% of those killed were white. This disproves the claim that blacks are simply shot and killed due to skin color. But this proves that blacks actually have higher percent chance of surviving an encounter with police. The real reason the black crime rate is so high, is due to the culture that has been formed in predominantly poor black, and also poor white communities. This is a culture of violence and gang activity. That's why we see a larger youth crime rate and single motherhood, (which seems to correlate with increased crime rate and poverty rates). Black students also tend to drop out more than their white colleagues. If these factors have nothing to do with a cultural system in these communities, than please explain to me in a message to my account on Instagram, what truly causes these factors. It is entirely cultural and societal standards that are to blame. If a black man or woman wishes to change their cultural, then the act of simply doing it, and acting it out and showing and helping others to break the chain of this toxic culture will be the solution. This is much better than the current habit of enforcing or helping it.</p>


     <h3>Rape Culture: Fact or Fiction</h3>
     <pre>
     
     
     </pre>
<p>Now, we move onward towards the issue of “rape culture” here in the United States. There is sexualization of women, but there is also a sexualization of men just as much. In an interview with Rhonda Rousey, a feminist asked her how she felt about the sexualization and so-called “impossible standards” for women in the new Hollywood superhero movies. Rhonda’s response was amazing. She went on to explain how both men and women are equally sexualized in those movies, such as Captain America. Furthermore, that the characters should be superhuman because they are indeed supposed to be superheroes and have superhuman looks and abilities. Sex sells for both genders, the difference is that men are more used to it, and shrug off those remarks more than women. Also they don't try and play the victim as much as women, and most feminists try to do.</p>

<p>The term “rape culture” implies that we live in a society that supports or condones rape. I personally find this to be completely false. If any person can point me in the direction of a city, state, or a federal official that endorses rape and promotes men to go out and rape, I will gladly retract my statement. A rape culture is what the majority of Middle Eastern nations actually are in and actively practice. Women do not have nearly as many rights as men do, and men can treat women as simply property, or animals without any repercussions. Also they are actually encouraged to do so as to keep their households “in check”. Excuse my quick little tangent here, but why do feminists focus on the United States alone, a predominantly Christian nation that has extremely good levels of equality? Especially In the way of being treated equal before the law, and freedom choice. Instead feminists will defend places like Palestine or Saudi Arabia force women to wear Burkas, and will behead those who oppose their rulers. Whilst also allowing women to be raped and stoned to death, and on top of all that they will stone and behead gays. I just do not see the logic in simultaneously supporting these two contradicting beliefs.</p>
     <pre>

<p>Back to the United States, according to a study done in the late 1990s, about 40-53% of all rape accusations were shown to be false. They were false either to gain attention or for revenge, or other motives. These were women who admitted that these claims were false, when questioned, or were deemed to be false after a large investigation. The study also found that the number of rapes faked showed that the false rape claims were even greater in percentage to the actual rapes occurring. However, we do not know the exact data on how many were truly faked, since there are so many widely varying number of variables that have to be considered and calculated. Many feminists will use the term “victim blaming” and say that we must always believe the victim, until the accused is shown to be innocent. The truth is that this is the complete opposite way that our nation has practiced law since its founding. We were founded on the rule of law, and freedom with the belief that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. We can empathize, worry and care about the victim, but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by emotion. If we applied this feminist belief of guilty till proven innocent, than we are no better than third world dictatorships. This false narrative gives the opportunity for people to falsely accuse others they dislike of other heinous crimes to ruin their lives. For example one could accuse an annoying neighbor of robbery.</p>

     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can now see, the data and facts show that feminism has claims that are “true”, but under closer examination it is only true on the surface. For this reason, they draw false conclusions from them. In statistics, you can draw almost any conclusion from any data that you collect, depending on how you present it and gather it. That's why you must view all the data that has been collected, but also how it was collected.</p>
