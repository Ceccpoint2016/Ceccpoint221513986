            <h3>By @Minarchy (instagram)</h3>
            <p> The 2016 election season, to say the least, has been full of many surprising twists, unforeseeable by all sides. Who would expect prominent liberty-minded Republican Rand Paul to fall short of even a top five finish, or for a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist, Independent Bernie Sanders, to be a legitimate challenge to the establishment? However, no turn of events has been quite as shocking as the absurd rise of popularity for authoritarian conservative Donald Trump in the eyes of the Libertarian Party. The party, founded in the 1970s, has, since its birth, been about principles of restrained government, fiscal responsibility, and individual liberty. These policies have led to the rise of noted figures such as David Koch and Ron Paul. So, why the appeal for Trump? The billionaire real estate mogul’s policies have never been particularly libertarian. In fact, multiple speeches by Trump instead back just the opposite, that the man is a social conservative and economic liberal. With remarks such as “I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list…to buy guns”, it is apparent that he opposes even the most essential and basic natural rights. Taken directly from Trump’s twitter, this shows how he simply is not an advocate for civil liberties of all individuals, something the party has always been in strong support of. Multiple theories have arisen as to why Trump garners such a large block of support amongst allegedly liberty-minded individuals. One popular theory, from multiple libertarians, is that “Trump is a cultural libertarian”. Sorry, but you don’t typically use the words “cultural” and “libertarian” in the same sentence, as someone who believes in a state’s right to prohibit marriage of homosexuals. That would be considered authoritarianism. And the last time I checked, a progressively based income tax, something Trump has continually advocated for, is not a measure of freedom. What good is fighting the politically correct culture, a key aspect of the opposing argument, if your new culture is not any more liberty oriented? </p>
            <p> This same block of people are those who believe Gary Johnson, Libertarian presidential nominee, is a “liberaltarian”, and a “closet leftist”. They claim that Johnson is watering down and ruining the Libertarian Party, and no longer represents the party’s ideals. Quite on the contrary, what these “libertarians” fail to realize, is that Gary Johnson has a proven record of libertarianism. He is a strong opponent of the income tax, a defendant of the legalization of marijuana, and supports a foreign policy of true non-interventionism. During his tenure as Governor of New Mexico, he successfully cut taxes 14 times, balanced the budget, and removed governmental regulatory red tape, which was choking the free market and small businesses. New Mexico went from a multibillion dollar deficit, when Johnson assumed office, to a billion dollar surplus when he left office. This is a clear record of small government policy. These points, being factual, are irrefutable, which brings into eye the integrity of the Libertarians for Trump movement. There is, perhaps, a large amount of psychological projection, or accusing an opponent of what you yourself are guilty of, in play. The supposed Libertarians for Trump simply do not meet the definition of Libertarian, by any stretch whatsoever. </p>
            <p> While Johnson’s libertarianism is credibly defendable, Trump’s is based off of a very loose definition of cultural libertarianism, and is easily refutable by a simple examination of his policies. Rather than focusing on how Libertarians with the ideology of Gary Johnson are being impure and a threat, when talking about lack of unity within the Libertarian Party, our first focus should be directed towards those who clearly do not respect the ideals of limited government and personal liberty. This is like an immigrant moving into America and demanding that the Americans begin to adopt his culture, because his culture is inherently more American. The logic and consistency simply does not back up the claim. It is an absurd notion, which will only lead to further lack of unity, something we desperately need to avoid in the journey to 15% polling status. To break that threshold in stride, a unified party is required, which is an impossibility, so long as many members of the party have such a convoluted definition of liberty.</p>
