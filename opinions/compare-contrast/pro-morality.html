            <p>Morality itself can be explained as a person's ethics, and what they perceive as right vs. wrong. This is the stereotypical good vs. evil debate, but there is no such thing as good vs. evil on a grand scale. The only cases of good vs. evil are on smaller and more personal scales.</p>
            <p>These can be seen in today's world as some who oppose Trump or Clinton over “morality” reasons, because they see either one as a perceived evil in comparison to one another. A grander scale could be seen in the death and destruction of war, such as the strategic bombing of German cities in WW2, or even the Holocaust itself. Hitler himself, insane or not, believed he was doing a good deed in exterminating the Jewish cultural group, while others saw it as a very evil and heinous act.</p>
            <p>A race riot itself can also be seen through this lense. Some people view a race riot as morally justified, while others view at as being extremely morally ignorant or evil. It all depends on the perspective and person themselves. A human life itself is even subjective in nature. If you were forced to choose between a stranger’s life, and your friend’s, you'd choose your friend because it had more value to you.</p>
            <p>Nihilism is a perfect example of these thoughts. We have strayed away from older, societal morality, to a more personal and newer morality. This is to say, a more central morality that differs from person to person. Back before this slide into nihilistic thought, the main sources of morality were groups such as churches and other religious organizations. As society has moved into more recent times, we see individuals leaving the religions of our ancestors, and finding their own definitions of morality without even realizing it is occurring. Now nihilism itself has a very bad misconception for this very reason. It is a common misconception, that all the people who follow it are hollow and cold depressed individuals who have lost faith in the world. That isn’t always the case, but nihilism can lead to such personality characteristics because of its subjectiveness.</p>
            <p>This is the case because nihilism on the surface does in fact show that life is inherently meaningless, but true followers of nihilism know this to mean something good, not bad. The belief that nothing has value is just to say that the value has the same “base” value to everything else. Everything in life is subjective because you give it value. The gasoline in your car is only important because you make it that way because you want to have a car. You want to have it, so therefore it's value increases to you. If you were an African who walked to the water hole every day, gasoline has no value to you, it's actually the opposite, it's an obstacle to a clean the water supply.</p>
            <p>The same can be said about a human life, which is the darker side of nihilism. My life has value to me simply because I want to live onward, either for myself or for others. My life has value because of others, not simply because I am me. We all must make a choice as to whether something, or someone has value to us. Furthermore we ourselves every minute and every day meet someone new and get to know that person better than before. Nihilism has another key aspect, the will to power. The will to power is the belief that we strive onward to become stronger than before, whether it is physical or some other form of strength, is up to each individual, but it is still the will to power onward and accomplish deeds to better yourself.</p>
            <p>The will to power goes into the most important part of nihilism, the Übermensch, or the overman in English. The overman is the belief that an individual can overcome this nothingness eventually and set forth morality for the society to follow as well. The overman will be able to decide good from wrong subjectively for society to follow. Every inhibitors follower, in my opinion at least, should strive to become the overman of their own lives and escape the nothingness that makes up nihilism and bring others to see what truly has value and doesn't have value.</p>
