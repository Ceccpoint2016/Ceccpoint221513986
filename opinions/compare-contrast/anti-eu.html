            <p>A lot of the reasons that people use to defend the EU are either incredible over simplifications or simply wrong. I see no need for a European Union. To me it is an economic, cultural, and political hindrance. I shall attempt to explain below.</p>
            <p>It seems to me that the "common goals" of the EU seem less about acting in the best interests of the member nations, and more about importing single, middle-aged Arab men along with being mean to Greece. Seriously. The western world has become so integrated already that conflict between nations will not be resolved with war. It's not like Germany and France are going to go to war ever again. There is no need for common defense (except against Muslims, even Western Europe seems complacent) but I digress. Countries will grow together through peace initiatives, diplomacy, and economic treaties. Strong arming them into it, as the EU has done, only weakens the system and creates resentment. No one  seems to remember how quickly European alliances formed and transitioning ed between 1690 and 1914, or that through the genius of Bismarck, Germany and Austria had allied with Russia for a good part of the 1800s. The balance of power will of course shift without centralized government, but that's healthy. Countries are incentivized to maintain peace on their own anyway, and deserve the right to administer themselves according to their own laws. With this in mind, the EU has no practical purpose.</p>
            <p>There is a difference between true "free trade" and what is happening within the European Union. While sometimes it's easy to move goods across borders, regulations are so burdensome that it's impossible to do anything. Besides, the Euro is stupid. Instead of actually giving smaller countries better trade opportunities, it just gave leverage for bigger countries that actually print the money to turn smaller ones into economic puppet states. Part of the reason people in Southern Europe are getting pissed at the E.U., is because they see it as a German bankers' cult. The Euro is failing anyway. Why can't countries maintain their own currencies? Currency is intrinsically linked to economic independence, and competitive growth requires interdependence, not central management. To see this on a macro scale, look at the difference between Chilean economic reforms and Venezuela. Venezuela is a rainforest rich in oil, lumber, and gasoline, with some of the most beautiful nature in South America. Chile is a mountainous desert with a little bit of copper. I don't need to tell you that Chile's own reforms have given it the highest GDP and growth for three decades straight in South America. The EU needs to let countries act in their own best interests, not dominate them. And the EU will never relinquish that power.</p>
            <p>The EU (and even its predecessor intergovernmental organizations) were a bad idea from the very start. You cannot achieve true peace by taking away national sovereignty. Before WWI, the idea to keep peace in Europe was supposed to be collective security, where everybody could hang up on an aggressive country so they would back down. Look at Hitler, 1936-1939, nobody wanted to do anything so this principle fell apart. In response to WWII, the EEC was designed in 1953 so that member countries could control how much coal, steel, and other key industrial resources would go to other countries, limiting their capacity for war. In other words, an unelected, non-governmental body would have the power to cut off an entire nation at the knees. This idea is egregious in itself. Since then, these international controls have expanded exponentially. EU "countries" no longer have their own currency. They no longer have their own borders. They no longer have their own trade agreements with other countries. Their governments answer to Brussels. Is the EU the glittering realization of a peaceful, cooperating Europe that people have wanted since Napoleon and tried to implement since the 1940s? No, it is not. The EU is a vehicle of domination. Personally, I'd rather see Europe periodically decimated by war than see it arbitrarily cucked out for no reason whatsoever.</p>
