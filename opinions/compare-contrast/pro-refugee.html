            <p>“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ...”. Life in Syria is absolutely barbaric. People currently living in Syria are living a life of fear and despair. Each day that they live, could be their last, as barrel bombs are dropped on rebel-held territories on a regular basis. When these words were engraved onto the Statue of Liberty, they were engraved as principles on what this nation ought stand for. Today, these words are being challenged by those who want to close America’s borders to the thousands of Syrian refugees who are fighting to escape a war zone in search for a better life.</p>
            <p>It is a moral obligation for the United States to accept these Syrian refugees. As the leader of the free world, we ought to join the rest of the world by taking charge of this humanitarian crisis. The naysayers believe that America should focus more on combating terrorism in Syria, rather than giving Syrians a free pass to enter this country. I disagree. If the goal is to combat extremism, then taking refugees is a better tactic than letting them anguish in ghastly camps.</p>
            <p>This notion that Syrian refugees who are entering the United States are going through very little background checks is simply not true. Since Sept. 11, 2001, America has resettled 784,000 refugees, according to the Department of Homeland Security; to enter the United States with refugee status, you must go through a very thorough extensive background check that can take as long as 18 months. This background check is so extensive, that the FBI reported that “no competent terrorist would choose the U.S. refugee process as a preferred strategy for gaining entry into the U.S.”</p>
