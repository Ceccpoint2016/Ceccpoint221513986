            <h3>Pinospookus</h3>
            <p>The topic we will be discussing is the Migrant Crisis in Europe and how it affects the USA.</p>
            <p>The thing about the Migrants is that there is a correlation with crime rates and their numbers increasing. Look Germany for example, where in the past year migrants have played a large role in the sharply increasing crime rate or more than 300,000 (according to the Gatestone Institute and Statisa). Also, much of the mainstream media is saying that it consists of women and young children, which is dead WRONG. According to the Unhcr, the refugee camp population is 48% of girls and 52% of Men and the rural/peri-urban population of them is Girls 48.5% and Men at 51.5%.</p>
            <p>This also affects France because in a poll done by Russia Today it has shown that 64% out of ~1,500 French citizens said that refugees are a source of crime in France. There are many stories related to refugees committing crimes on the highway in Calais. One example of this was when 15 migrants attacked a family that was doing nothing harmful to them, and set them on fire leaving the family with serious injuries. This was done in an attempt to scare off the truck drivers. In Sweden, refugees commit 77% of rape despite them being 2% of the population. Furthermore, they took in so many refugees that the ‘no-go zones’ has gone up to 55 while the police is losing control. Finally, there are many stories related to refugees in Sweden committing brutal crimes and getting lenient sentences for those crimes. For example, when a Somali migrant raped a minor while commenting ‘Black D*ck is expensive’ gets 22 days in community service. Look, I can go more into the Refugee crisis in Europe but I’ll leave it here for you guys to see what’s the true idea behind this.</p>
            <p>The reasons why the Refugees will impact the us, is because of the cost of increased amounts of government provided money, for housing, food, jobs, etc. Secondly, we can’t focus on handling multiple groups of immigrants at the same time. Mexicans are coming in through the southern border, and we have to deal with them first. If we had to deal with Both of them at the same time, It would highly problematic. Finally, we have high poverty rates, and veterans in need. We could be helping the poor and veterans, rather than wasting money helping a group of immigrants.</p>
            <p>The main point is that these ‘refugees’ cause increased crime rates and more problems in general. It is my contention, that the only solution is to stop the mass migration at the United States Borders.</p>
