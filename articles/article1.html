     <h2> Fascism: the greatest political paradox that exists	</h2>

     <h3>By, Michael Vanelli</h3>


<p>Fascism is quite possibly the greatest political paradox to exist. In numerous critical pieces of its ideology, Fascism contradicts the common knowledge of today's and yesterday's libertarian thinkers. Even more so, fascism constantly contradicts its own ideological strongholds.

To understand why Fascism so often leads to a twisted brutal world, it's necessary to first understand what Fascism is. Popularized by WWII era Italy, and its dictator Benito Mussolini, Fascism has made appearances across the world, From Augusto Pinochet in Chile to Franco in Spain.
   
Fascism does have a slippery definition, but it's results are clear and have undeniable authoritarian streaks. Fascism itself is a social system. It is one where a state or government takes control of a nation's culture, hijacking its citizens freedom along the way. This can range from forcing a religion in a theocratic state to forcing an anti-religious atheistic state. It can lead to a conservative nation, or a liberal nation, sad or angry, guilty or carefree. The first paradox appears right here. The country under fascism could be anything the people want it to be, the catch is that the people don't get to decide. That decision comes down to whoever the dictator is. The one rule that never varies with government culture is that you can't disagree with the government's preferred, usually nationalist culture.
   
     
The first argument for fascism is that it forces a culture that will keep the country strong and prosperous. This is a claim that it will supposedly help the nation, and make the unified people a force not to be reckoned with. The major flaw in this is when government drives people towards a cultural goal, the tunnel vision of that government can often, as history shows, lead to a loss of the real goal behind it. Whatever goal the government sets, whether to free markets for better living conditions, like Pinochet in Chile, or win a war, like Benito Mussolini in Italy, or even to avoid a war and Simply foster a culture that the dictator decides on, such as Francisco Franco did in Spain, the real goal behind it all is to make life better for the community.
    

Take Pinochet, for example. In Chile, Augusto Pinochet ran a strict regime, freeing the economy to its fullest extent, and bolstering the Chilean economy heavily. In this sick paradox however, anyone supporting ideas that threatened his regime, particularly communism, was brutally killed. Mainly as a message for the others and a precaution for his power. Pinochet literally would hang these political enemies on a noose attached to a helicopter.
    
He freed up the economy, sure, and maybe the murder of communists helped him do that, but the overall goal of the people, to have a government that improves their lives, really falls apart when people can't even speak their mind. Even on one for the most basic political issues without fear of a brutal murder that nobody else could stop.</p>

  Franco's Spain is another great example of this. 
  In a unique case, Franco allowed people opposed to his regime to simply leave, and not bother to fight a losing battle.
  Unfortunately for the people of Spain, it's not so easy to leave a country while its neighbors are engulfed in a world war.
  Many people were still loyal to their families, churches, and friends in Spain, causing them to stay and endure his 45 year reign.
  Franco's granting of freedom of movement helped some, but the rest had to endure the economic travesty he would wreak on the country.
  Franco had used a brand of fascism that dismantled free trade, and had tended to the whims of strong corporations, resulting in destruction of competition, which slowed Spain's growth significantly.
  This started a slump that lasted nearly half a century long.
  Anyone who opposed him were kept as long term political prisoners, oddly enough the people who needed to leave the country most of them ended up not being able to.
  For forty five years Spain had to deal with a dictator that ruined their economy.
  This was a result of fascism's unparalleled government-supporting streak stopped anyone from standing up to him.
  Mussolini was caught by his own citizens at the end of his reign.
  He blatantly forced the same economic model as Spain, and literally put his country on the Nazi's Side of WWII.
  Another trouble with fascism is that it is giving one dictator the power to rule a country of subjects, to satisfy whatever the dictators next whim is.
  People constantly being killed by the three regimes mentioned, and countless others, is a common theme in fascism.
  Because no matter how good the original intentions, one person in charge of an entire nation will abuse that power sooner or later.
  This occurs time, and time again.
  Fascism works on the assumption that people are too stupid to make their own cultural decisions, but then ironically (and again paradoxically) decides that one person is smart enough to make those decisions for everyone.
  No matter how it's done, fascism is a dangerous idea that repeats the same mistakes on the same illogical principles.
  The only difference is the individual person who gets to carelessly make the personal decisions for millions of people.
