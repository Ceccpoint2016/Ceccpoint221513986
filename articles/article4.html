     <h2>A Libertarian Objectivists Political and Moral View on Transgenderism</h2>
		<h3>By, rebel.libertarian</h3>

<p>As a libertarian, the fundamental of my political ideology is that man and woman should be free to do as they please, so long as their decisions and actions do not effect anyone else. The freedom of someone to choose to undergo gender reassignment surgery, or dress as the opposite sex is one that should not be opposed by the government on any grounds. As an objectivist, though, I do not agree with, or believe in transgenderism on a personal level. I also believe though that social opposition and disagreement, protected by the first amendment, is something that should never be silenced, even when designated as “hate speech.” The transgender and transsexual (the first being someone who does not wish to live under their birth sex and the second being someone who wishes to receive gender reassignment surgery) debate should not be thought of in the sense of a zero-sum game, where one side either loses their right to live as they see fit, or the other loses their ability to criticize.
	The political right of someone to be transgender or transsexual should not be opposed. Dressing as the opposite sex or choosing to undergo gender reassignment surgery does not affect others. When interacting with someone who is transgender or transsexual, assuming they do not make unwanted sexual advances, you are not harmfully affected by that interaction. While people may be ideologically opposed to someone being trans, uncomfortableness is not grounds for barring someone from exercising their rights politically. If it were, that subjective metric of comfort would be reason to keep people from freely practicing their own religion, their freedom of speech, their right to protest, etc. When a trans person attempts to use a restroom that does not correspond with their birth sex, which seems to be the prevalent debate going on today, rights are not infringed upon. The Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, also known as HB2, prohibits trans people from using restrooms that do not correspond with the sex on their birth certificate on the grounds of privacy. The question is, though, what privacy is being infringed upon exclusively with trans people being in the restroom? When any other person uses the restroom, you have the same degree of privacy when using identical facilities as you do when a trans person or someone of the opposite sex is present. While you may find it awkward or strange, there is no legal protection from you feeling this way, just as there is no legal right protecting you from hearing things that you do not want to hear. It would be different if a trans person sexually harassed or assaulted you, but simply being present does nothing.
	However, just as someone who is trans has the political right to be that way, someone who is not and who does not agree with their choices personally should not be kept from speaking their mind or altering their lives or personal property to accommodate those views. Taking away someone’s right to free speech because you do not agree with what they have to say is unacceptable. “Hate speech” or not, people should be able to say what they want as long as nothing turns physical. No one owes you acceptance.</p>

<p>The problem personally that I, and many others, have with transgenderism is the irrational misunderstanding of the relationship between sex and gender. Sex is binary. A person is, almost always, born either a male or a female. In very rare cases someone can be born with sexual variations that do not fit the traditional notion of female or male bodies. The two most prevalent sexual variations range from one in every 1000 births for Klinefelter syndrome, to one in every 2710 births for Turner syndrome. The overwhelming majority of people, though, are born either male or female, having chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, reproductive anatomy, and external genitalia that all correspond with either one sex or the other. 
Gender, on the other hand, is socially constructed. It focuses on things mostly attributed to the social roles of males and females. Whereas males are, according to gender norms, expected to be masculine, femininity is the preferred trait for females. Qualities like restricted emotions, less intimacy, orientation towards achievement, self-reliance, strength, and aggression make up the construct of masculinity. Whereas empathy, gentleness, sensitivity, emotionality, intimacy, family orientation, and reliance compose femininity. 
While sex does affect the role that people are thought to have in society culturally, whether that is good or bad, gender cannot affect sex. To believe so, in my opinion, goes against rationality. It doesn’t matter how much you believe that you are not supposed to be the sex that you were born as, you never will be. In your heart of hearts, you can believe that water will run up hill, but it never will in reality. Just because you are born a man or a woman does not mean that you need to possess the same traits that society believes necessary in terms of masculinity or femininity. However to not agree that you are a female or male contrary to your sexual makeup is delusional to me. As such, I tend to agree with Dr. John McHugh in believing that trans people suffer from a form of body dysmorphia.</p>
